  Example of a map generated using the MapServer [CGI Controls](https://mapserver.org/cgi/controls.html).
  Using OpenLayers and MapServer WMS services remains the recommended approach,
  but the CGI interface allows testing a Mapfile without having to configure WMS services. The Mapfile
  used in this example can be seen [here](https://demo.mapserver.org/itasca_legend/itasca3.txt).
